# rPi-IEEE1588
An IEEE1588 Precision Time Protocol Time Synchronization Algorithm implementation for the Raspberry Pi with a goal to minimize latency and network jitter. Only tested using a Windows host machine 

Originally designed in Python, then implemented in C, and planning to use kernel bypass to reduce delay and jitter.
